# Roadmap

## Backbone (revised per ADR-008 — app-first)
- F-01: Method — the convention itself (method/), usable by hand
- F-02: App shell + board — Tauri app, read-only story map rendered
  beautifully from files
- F-03: In-app genesis — planning interview as split view (planner
  chat + board materializing live); archaeology variant
- F-04: Dispatch — worktrees, model@session, verify/merge, from the
  board; CLI as plumbing/power path
- F-05: Rooms, sessions & daemon — @mention routing, resolutions,
  registry pane
- F-06: Architecture map — intent + reality overlaid, drift as a
  first-class signal (docs/design/map-technical-plan.md, ADR-013/014/
  015; added 2026-08-15, sequencing open in rooms/map-sequencing.md)

## Milestones
### Milestone 0 — planning (current)
Goal: interview completed, milestone 1 decomposed into exact tasks.
- [x] Convention v0.1.3 (EARS, touches, security sweep, succession,
      suggestions, room resolutions)
- [x] Market map + steal list (docs/research/competitors.md)
- [x] Interview complete, Q1–Q7 (rooms/first-user.md; NORTH_STAR)
- [x] Name decided: nputer (rooms/naming.md; npm/PyPI free)
- [ ] Domain + trademark sweep for "nputer"
- [x] Decomposition pass → docs/tasks/ T-001…T-007

### Milestone 1 — the mirror (scoped 2026-08-14, interview Q7)
Goal: open the nputer app and watch nputer being built on its own
board — read-only story map of this repo, rendered beautifully;
the method run by hand underneath (the coherence experiment starts
at T-001). Deliberately feels too small. Tasks: T-001…T-007.
Progress: COMPLETE 2026-08-15 — T-001…T-007 all through the
pipeline; design language applied. Launch-screenshot judgment with
@human.

### Milestone 2 — the map slice (decided 2026-08-15, rooms/map-sequencing.md)
Goal: the architecture map's vertical slice on nputer's own repo —
component files + TS indexer + derivation + T0 map view (T-008 →
T-009 → T-011 → T-012). Starts only after T-006 closes milestone 1.
Progress: T-008 done (2026-08-15); T-009 building.

### Milestone 3 — in-app genesis (F-03)
Goal: the planning interview as split view; decomposed at its own
/plan review. The F-06 remainder (T-010, T-013, T-014, T-015 —
milestone 4) re-enters after it.

## Parked
The staged future lives in docs/future.md (two expert-room batches:
v0.2 cost telemetry, retro role, sandboxing, pocket cockpit; v0.3
N-version, spec red team, time machine, handoff score, dry run;
horizon: truth maintenance, production feedback, synthetic users,
seeds, explainer, proof of process). Nothing there enters scope until
the first real project run — one recorded exception: the
architecture-drift slice of truth maintenance was pulled forward into
F-06 v1 by human directive (ADR-013, 2026-08-15).
