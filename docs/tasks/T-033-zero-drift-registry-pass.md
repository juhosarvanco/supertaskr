Absorbs: T-008-s2, T-011-s2, T-024-s5 (the derive-the-pin half; the
written inventory was ratified straight into docs/CONVENTIONS.md at
the 2026-08-16 triage, the T-009-s1 pattern). Triage 2026-08-16: the map's two classes
of PERMANENT amber on this repo, each flagged at birth and deferred
deliberately (T-012 §2: "the structural fix … is exactly open
suggestion T-008-s2 — not this task"). Plan §10 wants the repo at
zero drift before launch — this task is that gate's registry half
(C-07's D3 clears separately at T-010). Decisions at dispatch
(ADR-004 — the registry is the architect's pen; record the picks in
this file's plan section before dispatch):
(1) umbrella story — author a shared-ui component (next free C id at
    authoring time) claiming app/src/lib/utils.ts +
    app/src/components/ui/** with children declaring depends_on it,
    OR declare the existing observed edges and accept the cycles,
    OR keep the amber as the standing drift demo (then this half
    closes as accept-and-record). THE SAME QUESTION IS ASKED TWICE AND
    IS RULED ONCE HERE: C-05->C-13 and C-05->C-14 are both live
    undeclared D1 rows the map draws, both created by C-05's
    `app/test/**` umbrella reaching a child component's module, and
    both were deliberately left undeclared by their integrators on the
    grounds that a `depends_on` edit is a REGISTRY ruling. Declare
    both, declare neither, or write down why umbrella TEST edges do
    not count — one answer applied to both, recorded here before
    dispatch (integrator observation, 2026-08-16);
(2) non-code story — a component-file field (`non_code: true` or the
    existing layer vocabulary) downgrading D3 to informational for
    C-01/C-11, OR accepted permanent amber recorded in their prose.

## Acceptance criteria
- WHEN the umbrella decision applies THE standing D1 findings whose
  mechanism is the shared-primitive/test umbrella SHALL drain (or be
  recorded as accepted) per the recorded decision — registry edits,
  dogfood fixture deltas, and graph regen in ONE change, every
  expectation delta listed in notes (the T-012 §2 discipline:
  changed, never silently loosened).
- WHEN the non-code decision applies THE D3 findings for C-01 and
  C-11 SHALL either downgrade to informational (C-06 parser field +
  derivation + rendering, each a small additive change with tests)
  or be recorded as accepted in the component files — after this
  task the map's findings on this repo SHALL be exactly the honest
  not-yet-built set.
- IF a format field is added THEN parse of every existing component
  file SHALL be unchanged (additive only), pinned by the live-tree
  smoke discipline.
- THE lib/parser live-registry pin SHALL assert what it MEANS —
  consistency between docs/architecture/components/ and the parsed
  set — by deriving its expectation from the directory listing rather
  than a hand-written id array, so declaring a component stops
  breaking a frozen count inside a package whose task fences say "zero
  diff under lib/parser/**"; and the enumerated reconciliation block
  in app/test/architecture-dogfood.test.ts SHALL name its two sibling
  fixtures (T-024-s5).
