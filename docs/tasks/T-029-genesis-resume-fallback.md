The succession guarantee applied to the interview: files are the only
state that matters, so an app restart mid-interview loses nothing,
and a missing CLI degrades to the method's manual protocol rendered
live — option (b) as a first-class MODE (the ADR-006 instrument),
not a separate build.

## Acceptance criteria
- WHEN the app reopens a project with an in-flight genesis (genesis
  eligibility true + a live .nputer/sessions.json planner entry or
  .nputer/genesis/ present) THE app SHALL offer resume: respawn via
  the adapter's resume template with the recorded native session id,
  chat history rehydrated from transcript.jsonl when present; the
  derived stage and banked artifacts come from docs/ (truth), never
  from the cache.
- IF the transcript cache is missing or corrupt THEN resume SHALL
  still work from docs/ + the session id, rendering banked-progress
  summary in place of history (losable-by-charter, pinned in tests).
- IF the native session no longer resumes (CLI error) THEN the app
  SHALL offer continue-with-a-fresh-session: kickoff assembled with
  T-023's resume rule (read the banked docs, state the next stage,
  continue) — degraded, never dead.
- WHEN no supported CLI is found (T-025's typed not-found) THE
  genesis screen SHALL render the hand-driven mode: the fully
  assembled kickoff prompt in a copyable block ("run this in any
  agent CLI in your terminal — I'll render what lands"), the T-024
  lens live on the right, and the same completion detection
  (T-028) — the split-view magic with zero agent plumbing, any
  model, any CLI.
- IF the user cancels a spawned interview THEN the child process
  SHALL be dead (T-025's kill contract exercised from the UI path),
  docs/ untouched, and the project SHALL remain openable/resumable.

Verification: headless — served-bundle + cargo restart-simulation
tests (kill mid-interview at a scripted stage, reopen, both resume
paths; cache-corruption fixture; not-found routing). @human, listed
explicitly: one real hand-driven run in the fallback mode (this
doubles as an ADR-006 manual-interview instrument check).
